# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This web application provides an interactive platform to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. From classic bubble sort to advanced quicksort, witness how these algorithms efficiently arrange elements in ascending order.

## Algorithms Included:
- **Bubble Sort**: This simple sorting algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted.
- **Insertion Sort**: Insertion sort builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It repeatedly takes the next item and inserts it into the sorted portion of the array.
- **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quicksort**: Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Features:
